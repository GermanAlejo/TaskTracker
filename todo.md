Switching to a task tracker app is a great choice! Here's an updated guide tailored to a **Task Tracker Application** that lets users manage daily or general tasks, including deadlines, priority levels, and task categories.

### **Step-by-Step Guide for Task Tracker Application**

---

### **1. Core Features**

   - **User Authentication**: Allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - **Task Management**: Users can create, edit, delete, and organize tasks. Tasks should have attributes like title, description, due date, priority level, and status (e.g., pending, completed).
   - **Categories & Tags**: Organize tasks with categories (e.g., Work, Personal) and optional tags (e.g., “Urgent”).
   - **Task Lists and Filters**: Allow users to filter tasks by date, priority, status, and category.
   - **Calendar & Reminder**: Visualize tasks on a calendar and provide reminders for due tasks.

---

### **2. Database Design (SQL)**

   - **Tables**: Define `Users`, `Tasks`, `Categories`, and `Tags` tables.
   - **Relationships**:
     - Link `Users` and `Tasks` (one-to-many relationship).
     - Use a many-to-many relationship between `Tasks` and `Tags` to allow multiple tags for each task.
     - Link `Tasks` and `Categories` in a many-to-one relationship.
   - **Task History (Optional)**: Add a `Task_History` table to log task changes like completion or updates.

---

### **3. Backend (GraphQL API with Node.js)**

1. **Define the GraphQL Schema**:
   - Create types for `User`, `Task`, `Category`, `Tag`, and `TaskHistory`.
   - Write queries like `getUserTasks`, `getTasksByCategory`, and `getTaskHistory`.
   - Write mutations like `createTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`, and `assignTags`.

2. **Resolvers and Business Logic**:
   - Write resolvers for each query and mutation to interact with the database.
   - Include task filtering and sorting logic in the `getUserTasks` query.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Use JWT for authentication.
   - Create middleware to secure certain queries and mutations, restricting access to each user's own data.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for GraphQL resolvers (using Jest or Mocha).
   - Test core functionality like task creation, updating, and task filtering.

---

### **4. Frontend (React + TypeScript)**

1. **Basic UI Components**:
   - Create reusable components like `Button`, `Input`, `Checkbox`, `Dropdown`, and `Modal`.
   - Develop a main layout with sections for Dashboard, Task List, Calendar, and Profile.

2. **Build Pages**:
   - **Dashboard**: Show an overview of the user's tasks, deadlines, and task completion stats.
   - **Task List**: Allow users to view, filter, and sort tasks. Provide options to edit, delete, or mark tasks as complete.
   - **Task Detail View**: Show details of a task, including description, due date, and tags. Allow editing here.
   - **Calendar**: Visualize tasks on a monthly or weekly calendar view.
   
3. **GraphQL Integration with Apollo Client**:
   - Use Apollo Client to manage GraphQL queries and mutations for tasks, categories, and tags.
   - Handle loading and error states, and provide feedback on task actions (e.g., task added, completed).

---

### **5. Advanced Features**

1. **Reminders & Notifications**:
   - Implement reminder notifications for upcoming or due tasks.
   - Use local notifications for reminders (optional WebSocket setup for real-time reminders).

2. **Task Analytics**:
   - Create a statistics page with task completion rates, overdue tasks, and task distribution by category.
   - Visualize data using Chart.js or D3 for trends and insights.

---

### **6. Final Testing and Deployment**

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the frontend for usability and task management workflows.
   - Run end-to-end tests to ensure smooth interaction between backend and frontend.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document the GraphQL API schema and provide usage examples.
   - Add setup instructions, including for deployment.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend (Node.js server) and SQL database to a service like Heroku or AWS.
   - Deploy the frontend to a service like Vercel or Netlify, connecting to the backend.
   - Secure environment variables and ensure any private keys or sensitive data are kept secure.
